# Thermocline Analysis Project

This project focuses on extracting and analyzing oceanographic data from CSV files to compute the **thermocline** â€” the layer in a body of water where the temperature gradient is steeper than the warmer layer above and the colder layer below.  

It builds upon skills in:
- **Regex parsing**
- **File handling with `readline`**
- **Numerical analysis using NumPy**
- **Data interpretation and visualization**

### Key Features
- Parsing environmental datasets (temperature, density, etc.) from multiple `.csv` files.
- Identifying and computing the thermocline depth from ocean temperature profiles.
- Modular design separating data extraction (`extract.py`), computation (`thermocline.py`), and testing (`testThermocline.py`).

### Skills Demonstrated
- Functional programming in Python
- Data cleaning and structuring
- Scientific computation and plotting

> This project showcases how data science principles can be applied to real-world environmental problems, especially in the context of marine science.
